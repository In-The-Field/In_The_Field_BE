# In the Field

![Alt text](image.png)

## About This Project
### Important to Note
This is an SOA app and needs both this repo (back end) AND [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) ](https://github.com/In-The-Field/In_The_Field_FE) (front end) in order to be fully functioning.

### Mod 4 Capstone Project
In the Field is a mushroom identification app. Designed for folks looking to explore, learn about, and identify mushrooms. In the Field has the ability for registered users to upload pictures from mushrooms they have found in the wild and get a list of probable matches complete with information about said mushroom. Users also have the ability to create their own field guide of mushrooms they have saved.

## Purpose

The purpose of the backend for the In the Field app is to support the overall functionality and effectiveness of the platform. Here are some key purposes of the backend in relation to the project:

<b><u>Data management:</u></b> The backend serves as the central hub for storing, organizing, and managing the data associated with potential mushroom matches and data, and user profiles. It provides the necessary infrastructure and databases to efficiently handle the large volume of information generated by the app's users.

<b><u>User-generated content management:</u></b> The backend handles the uploading, storage, and retrieval of user-generated content. It ensures efficient data handling and metadata management. 

<b><u>Community interaction and engagement:</u></b> The backend hopes to supports community-driven features, such as information sharing regarding found mushrooms, locations, uses, etc. Future features would enables users to interact with each other through comments, likes, and replies, fostering a sense of community and encouraging user engagement. The backend would ensures smooth communication and real-time updates within the app, enhancing the overall user experience.

Overall, the purpose of the backend in the In the Field app is to support seamless data management and community engagement. It plays a vital role in ensuring the app's functionality, security, and user satisfaction, ultimately enhancing the experience of those folks who love to get outside and learn about the natural world around them.
